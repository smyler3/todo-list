// You are currently adding event listeners to the action buttons on cards
// --- Right now that is the delete button which brings up a confirmation form
// ---> So you need to work on making the forms into modals 

// ---->
// Add event listeners to the submit and close buttons on the form which will hide the modal
// Also change the forms to no longer use a parent but to instead be modals that can be hidden and shown
