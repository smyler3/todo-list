## A todo list website built using JS Modules

#### There are three different ways to organise your todo list:

    Projects:
        A project is like a folder, holding a collection of tasks
        They have a title and a description, and can be organized by colour 

    Tasks:
        A task is what is says on the tin, a job that needs completing
        They have a title, a description, a due date, and are organized by priority

    Steps:
        A Step is a way to futher break down a task into additonal smaller tasks
        They only have a title
